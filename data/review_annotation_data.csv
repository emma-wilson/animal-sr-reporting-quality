30bddfe2-0c8e-4bc7-9a44-7be1da9bd3a5,Aberrant IL-17 Levels in Rodent Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review,A. J. Thawley;L. P. Veneziani;F. D. Rabelo-da-Ponte;I. Riederer;D. A. Mendes-da-Cruz;V. Bambini-Junior,Front Immunol,Front Immunol,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by stereotyped behaviours, specific interests, and impaired communication skills. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-17A (IL-17A or IL-17), have been implicated as part of immune alterations that may contribute to this outcome. In this context, rodent models have helped elucidate the role of T-cell activation and IL-17 secretion in the pathogenesis of ASD. Regarding the preclinical findings, the data available is contradictory in offspring but not in the pregnant dams, pointing to IL-17 as one of the main drivers of altered behaviour in some models ASD, whilst there are no alterations described in IL-17 levels in others. To address this gap in the literature, a systematic review of altered IL-17 levels in rodent models of ASD was conducted. In total, 28 studies that explored IL-17 levels were included and observed that this cytokine was generally increased among the different models of ASD. The data compiled in this review can help the choice of animal models to study the role of cytokines in the development of ASD, seeking a parallel with immune alterations observed in individuals with this condition.

5a9e2688-0492-4c31-8c5b-14d203d9a8a7,Animal models of metabolic epilepsy and epilepsy associated metabolic dysfunction: A systematic review,U. P. Kundap;Y. N. Paudel;M. F. Shaikh,Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,"Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder affecting around 70 million people globally and is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Recent evidence indicates that dysfunction in metabolic processes can lead to the alteration of neuronal and network excitability, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis. Developing a suitable animal model that can recapitulate all the clinical phenotypes of human metabolic epilepsy (ME) is crucial yet challenging. The specific environment of many symptoms as well as the primary state of the applicable neurobiology, genetics, and lack of valid biomarkers/diagnostic tests are the key factors that hinder the process of developing a suitable animal model. The present systematic review summarizes the current state of available animal models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorders. A systematic search was performed by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) model. A range of electronic databases, including google scholar, Springer, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, were scanned between January 2000 and April 2020. Based on the selection criteria, 23 eligible articles were chosen and are discussed in the current review. Critical analysis of the selected literature delineated several available approaches that have been modeled into metabolic epilepsy and pointed out several drawbacks associated with the currently available models. The result describes available models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorder, such as mitochondrial respiration deficits, Lafora disease (LD) model-altered glycogen metabolism, causing epilepsy, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) deficiency, adiponectin responsive seizures, phospholipid dysfunction, glutaric aciduria, mitochondrial disorders, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) alpha-subunit gene (PDHA1), pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE), BCL2- associated agonist of cell death (BAD), Kcna1 knock out (KO), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (lncRNA CASC2). Finally, the review highlights certain focus areas that may increase the possibilities of developing more suitable animal models and underscores the importance of the rationalization of animal models and evaluation methods for studying ME. The review also suggests the pressing need of developing precise robust animal models and evaluation methods for investigating ME. Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

5a9e2688-0492-4c31-8c5b-14d203d9a8a7,Animal models of metabolic epilepsy and epilepsy associated metabolic dysfunction: A systematic review,U. P. Kundap;Y. N. Paudel;M. F. Shaikh,Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,"Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder affecting around 70 million people globally and is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Recent evidence indicates that dysfunction in metabolic processes can lead to the alteration of neuronal and network excitability, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis. Developing a suitable animal model that can recapitulate all the clinical phenotypes of human metabolic epilepsy (ME) is crucial yet challenging. The specific environment of many symptoms as well as the primary state of the applicable neurobiology, genetics, and lack of valid biomarkers/diagnostic tests are the key factors that hinder the process of developing a suitable animal model. The present systematic review summarizes the current state of available animal models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorders. A systematic search was performed by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) model. A range of electronic databases, including google scholar, Springer, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, were scanned between January 2000 and April 2020. Based on the selection criteria, 23 eligible articles were chosen and are discussed in the current review. Critical analysis of the selected literature delineated several available approaches that have been modeled into metabolic epilepsy and pointed out several drawbacks associated with the currently available models. The result describes available models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorder, such as mitochondrial respiration deficits, Lafora disease (LD) model-altered glycogen metabolism, causing epilepsy, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) deficiency, adiponectin responsive seizures, phospholipid dysfunction, glutaric aciduria, mitochondrial disorders, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) alpha-subunit gene (PDHA1), pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE), BCL2- associated agonist of cell death (BAD), Kcna1 knock out (KO), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (lncRNA CASC2). Finally, the review highlights certain focus areas that may increase the possibilities of developing more suitable animal models and underscores the importance of the rationalization of animal models and evaluation methods for studying ME. The review also suggests the pressing need of developing precise robust animal models and evaluation methods for investigating ME. Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Cheyne,J Neurodev Disord,J Neurodev Disord,"Autism is a complex condition with many traits, including differences in auditory sensitivity. Studies in human autism are plagued by the difficulty of controlling for aetiology, whereas studies in individual rodent models cannot represent the full spectrum of human autism. This systematic review compares results in auditory studies across a wide range of established rodent models of autism to mimic the wide range of aetiologies in the human population. A search was conducted in the PubMed and Web of Science databases to find primary research articles in mouse or rat models of autism which investigate central auditory processing. A total of 88 studies were included. These used non-invasive measures of auditory function, such as auditory brainstem response recordings, cortical event-related potentials, electroencephalography, and behavioural tests, which are translatable to human studies. They also included invasive measures, such as electrophysiology and histology, which shed insight on the origins of the phenotypes found in the non-invasive studies. The most consistent results across these studies were increased latency of the N1 peak of event-related potentials, decreased power and coherence of gamma activity in the auditory cortex, and increased auditory startle responses to high sound levels. Invasive studies indicated loss of subcortical inhibitory neurons, hyperactivity in the lateral superior olive and auditory thalamus, and reduced specificity of responses in the auditory cortex.

Cheyne,J Neurodev Disord,J Neurodev Disord,"Autism is a complex condition with many traits, including differences in auditory sensitivity. Studies in human autism are plagued by the difficulty of controlling for aetiology, whereas studies in individual rodent models cannot represent the full spectrum of human autism. This systematic review compares results in auditory studies across a wide range of established rodent models of autism to mimic the wide range of aetiologies in the human population. A search was conducted in the PubMed and Web of Science databases to find primary research articles in mouse or rat models of autism which investigate central auditory processing. A total of 88 studies were included. These used non-invasive measures of auditory function, such as auditory brainstem response recordings, cortical event-related potentials, electroencephalography, and behavioural tests, which are translatable to human studies. They also included invasive measures, such as electrophysiology and histology, which shed insight on the origins of the phenotypes found in the non-invasive studies. The most consistent results across these studies were increased latency of the N1 peak of event-related potentials, decreased power and coherence of gamma activity in the auditory cortex, and increased auditory startle responses to high sound levels. Invasive studies indicated loss of subcortical inhibitory neurons, hyperactivity in the lateral superior olive and auditory thalamus, and reduced specificity of responses in the auditory cortex.

De Castro;M. Vasconcelos;M. B. Abreu;R. F. Almeida;L. J. Bertoglio;A. P. Herrmann,Laboratory Animals,Laboratory Animals,"One of the crucial tools in studying brain molecular mechanisms and drug discovery is the usage of animal models. Understanding how consistently each behavior can be potentially studied in a given model can help to expand ASD research further. By conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence available in the literature, we hope to indicate which rodent models are most widely used or more suited for research in this area, enabling the assertion of models or compilation of models that present specific behavioral manifestations of ASD. In order to collect the most reliable information from original studies, a systematic review was conducted. Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. Following the searches, the duplicates were removed, and the records were screened independently by two reviewers. Studies should include one of six genetic models (Ube3a, Pten, Nlgn3, Shank3, Mecp2, and Fmr1) and behavioral testing. Studies are meta-analyzed using the R environment package metafor. After duplicates were removed, 24,983 records remained to be screened. The number of studies included in the qualitative synthesis is 531. Preliminary results show that Fmr1 is the most widely used genetic model of Autism in rodents with 248 studies. The FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) human gene, which codes for the fragile X mental retardation protein, may play a role in the development of synapses.

Nakai;T. Takumi;J. Nakai;M. Sato,Frontiers in Neuroscience,Frontiers in Neuroscience,"In vivo optical imaging is a powerful tool for revealing brain structure and function at both the circuit and cellular levels. Here, we provide a systematic review of findings obtained from in vivo imaging studies of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, including the monogenic disorders fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome, which are caused by genetic abnormalities of FMR1, MECP2, and UBE3A, as well as disorders caused by copy number variations (15q11-13 duplication and 22q11.2 deletion) and BTBR mice as an inbred strain model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most studies visualize the structural and functional responsiveness of cerebral cortical neurons to sensory stimuli and the developmental and experience-dependent changes in these responses as a model of brain functions affected by these disorders. The optical imaging techniques include two-photon microscopy of fluorescently labeled dendritic spines or neurons loaded with fluorescent calcium indicators and macroscopic imaging of cortical activity using calcium indicators, voltage-sensitive dyes or intrinsic optical signals. Studies have revealed alterations in the density, stability, and turnover of dendritic spines, aberrant cortical sensory responses, impaired inhibitory function, and concomitant failure of circuit maturation as common causes for neurological deficits. Mechanistic hypotheses derived from in vivo imaging also provide new directions for therapeutic interventions. For instance, it was recently demonstrated that early postnatal administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) restores impaired cortical inhibitory function and ameliorates the aberrant social behaviors in a mouse model of ASD. We discuss the potential use of SSRIs for treating ASDs in light of these findings.

9d0aa482-776a-40f7-b4e1-84656e44bfa8,Common defects of spine dynamics and circuit function in neurodevelopmental disorders: A systematic review of findings from in vivo optical imaging of mouse models,N. Nakai;T. Takumi;J. Nakai;M. Sato,Frontiers in Neuroscience,Frontiers in Neuroscience,"In vivo optical imaging is a powerful tool for revealing brain structure and function at both the circuit and cellular levels. Here, we provide a systematic review of findings obtained from in vivo imaging studies of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, including the monogenic disorders fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome, which are caused by genetic abnormalities of FMR1, MECP2, and UBE3A, as well as disorders caused by copy number variations (15q11-13 duplication and 22q11.2 deletion) and BTBR mice as an inbred strain model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most studies visualize the structural and functional responsiveness of cerebral cortical neurons to sensory stimuli and the developmental and experience-dependent changes in these responses as a model of brain functions affected by these disorders. The optical imaging techniques include two-photon microscopy of fluorescently labeled dendritic spines or neurons loaded with fluorescent calcium indicators and macroscopic imaging of cortical activity using calcium indicators, voltage-sensitive dyes or intrinsic optical signals. Studies have revealed alterations in the density, stability, and turnover of dendritic spines, aberrant cortical sensory responses, impaired inhibitory function, and concomitant failure of circuit maturation as common causes for neurological deficits. Mechanistic hypotheses derived from in vivo imaging also provide new directions for therapeutic interventions. For instance, it was recently demonstrated that early postnatal administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) restores impaired cortical inhibitory function and ameliorates the aberrant social behaviors in a mouse model of ASD. We discuss the potential use of SSRIs for treating ASDs in light of these findings.

05e1e2c3-a3e7-453b-8285-3ae147782892,Comparing the Gut Microbiome in Autism and Preclinical Models: A Systematic Review,M. U. Alamoudi;S. Hosie;A. E. Shindler;J. L. Wood;A. E. Franks;E. L. Hill-Yardin,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Many individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and show microbial dysbiosis. Variation in gut microbial populations is associated with increased risk for GI symptoms such as chronic constipation and diarrhoea, which decrease quality of life. Several preclinical models of autism also demonstrate microbial dysbiosis. Given that much pre-clinical research is conducted in mouse models, it is important to understand the similarities and differences between the gut microbiome in humans and these models in the context of autism. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, ProQuest and Scopus databases to compare microbiome profiles of patients with autism and transgenic (NL3(R451C), Shank3 KO, 15q dup), phenotype-first (BTBR) and environmental (Poly I:C, Maternal Inflammation Activation (MIA), valproate) mouse models of autism. Overall, we report changes in fecal microbial communities relevant to ASD based on both clinical and preclinical studies. Here, we identify an overlapping cluster of genera that are modified in both fecal samples from individuals with ASD and mouse models of autism. Specifically, we describe an increased abundance of Bilophila, Clostridium, Dorea and Lactobacillus and a decrease in Blautia genera in both humans and rodents relevant to this disorder. Studies in both humans and mice highlighted multidirectional changes in abundance (i.e. in some cases increased abundance whereas other reports showed decreases) for several genera including Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides and Prevotella, suggesting that these genera may be susceptible to modification in autism. Identification of these microbial profiles may assist in characterising underlying biological mechanisms involving host-microbe interactions and provide future therapeutic targets for improving gut health in autism.",internal-pdf://2313794002/pubmed-35846755.pdf,"School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), Bundoora, VIC, Australia.Medical Laboratory Technology Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.Department of Microbiology, Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Life Sciences, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia.",2022,10.3389/fcimb.2022.905841,Journal Article,"Animals;*Autism Spectrum Disorder;*Autistic Disorder;Disease Models, Animal;Dysbiosis/microbiology;*Gastrointestinal Diseases/microbiology;*Gastrointestinal Microbiome;Humans;Mice;Microfilament Proteins;Nerve Tissue Proteins;Quality of Life;autism;environmental;gastrointestinal tract;genetics;microbiota;mouse model",/2313794002/pubmed-35846755.pdf,,01/26/2023 12:10:28,556bcd82-e3b1-48bf-8485-72f315a79342,studies_with_pdf,FALSE,a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a,Malcolm Macleod,6643d153-9d56-43b4-bef9-272050563a84,Peer-reviewed journal,,dd031f90-d8fb-4bfc-a450-933103e21887,Systematic review only,,6907b8fa-b759-4f71-b665-774bca1dee7b,to compare preclinical and clinical studies of the microbiome in the context of autism spectrum disorder.,,b225a3e7-2711-4a17-a225-ee1c68ee0cbc,Animal studies;Clinical studies,,ea9a3141-82cf-4f38-89bf-93e036ac5f19,NL3R451C(Nlgn3tm1Sud/J); SHANK3KO; 15qdup; BTBR (BTBRTtf/J),,9c281124-06c7-42f1-b8c5-defc7806ec80,22,,bbc00c3f-d22c-4e2d-bb3b-aaab62fbd02b,-23,,ad589ba1-a30f-4b57-a1c4-a75d33d49840,Yes,,95697267-7004-42c9-ad2d-96263838d28b,Yes,,880b582c-7b0d-405a-99dd-f6ba2aeaa832,Yes,,2a83fc38-5876-48ab-a563-77ac44b9b931,Not applicable,,3d4b2dd6-d416-429c-8ac3-e2e971792b25,Yes,,59f600d4-a210-450d-a028-f67a34e1846f,No - protocol was not registered,,,,,f49b348f-a76e-4c50-a0b8-aa33512054f6,No - not reported or no protocol,,b039fff3-53f2-4520-887c-f77264538f05,Yes,,cd2820b5-a266-48db-853d-0f1742e30627,No,,d5176309-4209-4623-9f00-e49eb3879160,Not applicable,,22473094-a56a-4853-b428-5c281916e379,Not applicable,,2937562a-6e33-4e17-8139-7c4ca1f7bed4,Yes,,13cdd988-f262-4166-be08-f72df0debd0e,Not applicable,,646528d8-62b8-4924-bcd4-5b0ff558c482,Yes,,806a1b90-0503-4536-a744-2f020f18cf2e,No,,8f5dd47d-608a-472b-a0c8-79f9bd9f3a5e,No,,5f85c97b-7f8a-44d9-b3f3-0bb459dba02a,No,,cd59393b-a6a8-4a61-a720-b7eb0168c8b2,No,,27df5e89-fb2c-4dac-87b1-c096562c0613,This review does not include a meta-analysis,,102ea72c-2a78-4aea-9cfb-6e4b75ba9609,This review does not include a meta-analysis,,201e7902-3f46-4574-a749-2e8e38efeb05,This review does not include a meta-analysis,,5d32c56f-75e6-40f8-a693-9a250438337e,No,,1d992434-d777-41e9-a9a7-3dfa88b412dc,No,,4a9eef79-8a86-4852-ace0-4b8afc8b909f,Publication bias was not assessed,,8162509f-985b-4ed6-aff1-61595b41cd2d,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,453b8ef5-e0c4-43d4-ad72-f92ce8dc0f49,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,3bd65252-8695-4f6a-86b5-08c72370558c,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,cce6e599-d74c-42ae-97f3-72fcabdcd73c,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,39a70e51-accd-4512-9d0a-bf1f5b4a7e07,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,fef87509-ce14-4e77-84fb-f9f102b559f5,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,bd040485-0477-4b7d-b1b8-86261ec502be,Yes,,c406a866-6b19-4ea2-9c31-48cb8ae80c90,Yes,,e8895e3e-05e5-45b4-9d31-fa1696fbb4ca,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,2e09a276-5ba1-41a9-be99-a66fa52d5504,Yes,,3a3fcd55-71f0-4cae-9061-a0c9f01c4084,Yes,,d37eca64-75bf-42e7-a60c-39c94cda690d,Yes,,14e4efe0-0f7f-4b56-84d2-8588d639e676,No,,3f3a3630-5de6-4a98-9ca0-18ddb885acb8,Not applicable,,473ef32e-1ad9-4fa0-851e-0cf5643689ca,No,,beb08197-effc-42d3-8320-12de51a468cb,Yes,,5c64d986-8b11-4296-bca2-a02db96b8be1,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,31d6fc9b-9478-46f3-8eb7-8b381fa8f193,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,150623f7-6b4e-46a2-b44a-1c0a81ab53e3,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,b92f5cf2-6df2-445a-bb9a-c71e271ac404,Quantitative analysis not conducted,,3982e3e5-4e47-436f-8d49-0e4011d0179e,No - did not report,,54a8c30e-7b06-40b7-aa47-ce0248582ab4,Risk of bias was not assessed,,7a5c8a3b-cfcc-483d-9ea8-e57207c82421,No,,0719deaf-f639-47c5-9256-26df9e03bf82,No,,27e8a054-6fe1-473d-92ad-37760175dbee,Yes,,0ba4b7e9-7d43-4f23-a1b3-dcc72eed4773,No - not reported,,,,

Hill-Yardin,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Many individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and show microbial dysbiosis. Variation in gut microbial populations is associated with increased risk for GI symptoms such as chronic constipation and diarrhoea, which decrease quality of life. Several preclinical models of autism also demonstrate microbial dysbiosis. Given that much pre-clinical research is conducted in mouse models, it is important to understand the similarities and differences between the gut microbiome in humans and these models in the context of autism. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, ProQuest and Scopus databases to compare microbiome profiles of patients with autism and transgenic (NL3(R451C), Shank3 KO, 15q dup), phenotype-first (BTBR) and environmental (Poly I:C, Maternal Inflammation Activation (MIA), valproate) mouse models of autism. Overall, we report changes in fecal microbial communities relevant to ASD based on both clinical and preclinical studies. Here, we identify an overlapping cluster of genera that are modified in both fecal samples from individuals with ASD and mouse models of autism. Specifically, we describe an increased abundance of Bilophila, Clostridium, Dorea and Lactobacillus and a decrease in Blautia genera in both humans and rodents relevant to this disorder. Studies in both humans and mice highlighted multidirectional changes in abundance (i.e. in some cases increased abundance whereas other reports showed decreases) for several genera including Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides and Prevotella, suggesting that these genera may be susceptible to modification in autism.

Spruyt,Sleep Medicine,Sleep Medicine,"Introduction: Sleep problems are reported to be prevalent in individuals with Rett Syndrome (RTT, MIM 312750). RTT is a rare, progressive neurodevelopmental disease, characterized by loss of acquired language skills, stereotypic hand movements, and comprehensive cognitive, social, motor skill impairments. Typical and atypical variants have been defined, framing RTT when clinical features vary subtly. Due to the discovery of RTT genetic mutations, who are mostly located in the genes of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), cyclin dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) and forkhead box G1 (FOXG1), animal models have been developed. We will systematically review studies investigating sleep in animal models of RTT. Material(s) and Method(s): Five electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Ebsco and Scopus, were searched up till March 06 2020. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: sleep studies in RTT animal models including variants of Mecp2, Cdkl5 and Foxg1. Review papers, conference proceedings, thesis works and studies reporting ""sleep"" but not presenting data were excluded. Result(s): From 2005 to 2020, 13 studies investigating sleep in RTT animal models have been published. Five countries established an animal model for sleep: one in monkey, two in Drosophila and 10 in mouse. Disrupted sleep in these animal models presented to be enhanced waking state with increased fragmented sleep bouts, but no altered sleep duration/proportion within 24-h cycles. Findings in EEG spectral analysis revealed lower 4 Hz frequency wave (slow wave sleep) and decrease in the average number of delta cycles in 24-h cycles. Irregular circadian rhythm was displayed as decreased amount and rhythm amplitude of sleep-activity. Animal models also exhibited sleep breathing abnormalities particularly during NREM sleep. Conclusion(s): We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys and Drosophila. Models also presented circadian arrhythmicity.

550a6960-83db-47f3-a40b-05a2be158d27,Disrupted sleep in rett syndrome animal models,X. Y. Zhang;K. Spruyt,Sleep Medicine,Sleep Medicine,"Introduction: Sleep problems are reported to be prevalent in individuals with Rett Syndrome (RTT, MIM 312750). RTT is a rare, progressive neurodevelopmental disease, characterized by loss of acquired language skills, stereotypic hand movements, and comprehensive cognitive, social, motor skill impairments. Typical and atypical variants have been defined, framing RTT when clinical features vary subtly. Due to the discovery of RTT genetic mutations, who are mostly located in the genes of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), cyclin dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) and forkhead box G1 (FOXG1), animal models have been developed. We will systematically review studies investigating sleep in animal models of RTT. Material(s) and Method(s): Five electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Ebsco and Scopus, were searched up till March 06 2020. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: sleep studies in RTT animal models including variants of Mecp2, Cdkl5 and Foxg1. Review papers, conference proceedings, thesis works and studies reporting ""sleep"" but not presenting data were excluded. Result(s): From 2005 to 2020, 13 studies investigating sleep in RTT animal models have been published. Five countries established an animal model for sleep: one in monkey, two in Drosophila and 10 in mouse. Disrupted sleep in these animal models presented to be enhanced waking state with increased fragmented sleep bouts, but no altered sleep duration/proportion within 24-h cycles. Findings in EEG spectral analysis revealed lower 4 Hz frequency wave (slow wave sleep) and decrease in the average number of delta cycles in 24-h cycles. Irregular circadian rhythm was displayed as decreased amount and rhythm amplitude of sleep-activity. Animal models also exhibited sleep breathing abnormalities particularly during NREM sleep. Conclusion(s): We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys and Drosophila. Models also presented circadian arrhythmicity. Overall, animal models mimic sleep complaints reported in individuals with RTT. Animal models investigating sleep may unravel novel neural mechanisms for this severe neurodevelopmental rare disease.

3653d84d-1105-4226-8da4-981283aa254e,Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in Fragile X Syndrome and its relationship to behaviour: A systematic review,R. L. Hardiman;A. Bratt,Physiol Behav,Physiol Behav,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is characterised by features including anxiety and autistic-like behaviour, which led to early hypotheses that aberrant physiological arousal may underlie the behavioural phenotype. In line with this, several lines of evidence suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may be altered in the syndrome. This review collates evidence to determine the nature of HPA axis baseline activity and reactivity (as measured by glucocorticoid levels) differences in FXS, and its relationship to behaviour. Through a search of electronic databases, 15 papers were identified which provided data on humans with FXS or the FMR1 knockout mouse model. The findings across studies are mixed, though trends in the findings can be seen, including elevations in cortisol levels, particularly in males. Preliminary findings also highlight associations between cortisol levels and key behaviours associated with the syndrome, such as gaze avoidance.

Bratt,Physiol Behav,Physiol Behav,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is characterised by features including anxiety and autistic-like behaviour, which led to early hypotheses that aberrant physiological arousal may underlie the behavioural phenotype. In line with this, several lines of evidence suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may be altered in the syndrome. This review collates evidence to determine the nature of HPA axis baseline activity and reactivity (as measured by glucocorticoid levels) differences in FXS, and its relationship to behaviour. Through a search of electronic databases, 15 papers were identified which provided data on humans with FXS or the FMR1 knockout mouse model. The findings across studies are mixed, though trends in the findings can be seen, including elevations in cortisol levels, particularly in males. Preliminary findings also highlight associations between cortisol levels and key behaviours associated with the syndrome, such as gaze avoidance.

Stroganova,Clinical Neurophysiology,Clinical Neurophysiology,"Objective: Systematically review the abnormalities in event related potential (ERP) recorded in Rett Syndrome (RTT) patients and animals in search of translational biomarkers of deficits related to the particular neurophysiological processes of known genetic origin (MECP2 mutations). Method(s): Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge and BIORXIV were searched for the relevant articles according to PRISMA standards. Result(s): ERP components are generally delayed across all sensory modalities both in RTT patients and its animal model, while findings on ERPs amplitude strongly depend on stimulus properties and presentation rate. Studies on RTT animal models uncovered the abnormalities in the excitatory and inhibitory transmission as critical mechanisms underlying the ERPs changes, but showed that even similar ERP alterations in auditory and visual domains have a diverse neural basis. A range of novel approaches has been developed in animal studies bringing along the meaningful neurophysiological interpretation of ERP measures in RTT patients. Conclusion(s): While there is a clear evidence for sensory ERPs abnormalities in RTT, to further advance the field there is a need in a large-scale ERP studies with the functionally-relevant experimental paradigms. Significance: The review provides insights into domain-specific neural basis of the ERP abnormalities and promotes clinical application of the ERP measures as the non-invasive functional biomarkers of RTT pathophysiology.

36ea027d-eea1-491d-a45e-b38df1f73bae,Sensory evoked potentials in patients with Rett syndrome through the lens of animal studies: Systematic review,O. V. Sysoeva;K. Smirnov;T. A. Stroganova,Clinical Neurophysiology,Clinical Neurophysiology,"Objective: Systematically review the abnormalities in event related potential (ERP) recorded in Rett Syndrome (RTT) patients and animals in search of translational biomarkers of deficits related to the particular neurophysiological processes of known genetic origin (MECP2 mutations). Method(s): Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge and BIORXIV were searched for the relevant articles according to PRISMA standards. Result(s): ERP components are generally delayed across all sensory modalities both in RTT patients and its animal model, while findings on ERPs amplitude strongly depend on stimulus properties and presentation rate. Studies on RTT animal models uncovered the abnormalities in the excitatory and inhibitory transmission as critical mechanisms underlying the ERPs changes, but showed that even similar ERP alterations in auditory and visual domains have a diverse neural basis. A range of novel approaches has been developed in animal studies bringing along the meaningful neurophysiological interpretation of ERP measures in RTT patients. Conclusion(s): While there is a clear evidence for sensory ERPs abnormalities in RTT, to further advance the field there is a need in a large-scale ERP studies with the functionally-relevant experimental paradigms. Significance: The review provides insights into domain-specific neural basis of the ERP abnormalities and promotes clinical application of the ERP measures as the non-invasive functional biomarkers of RTT pathophysiology.

Arenkiel,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"Olfactory impairment is a common clinical motif across neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting olfactory circuits are particularly vulnerable to disease processes and can provide insight into underlying disease mechanisms. The mouse olfactory bulb is an ideal model system to study mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disease due to its anatomical accessibility, behavioral relevance, ease of measuring circuit input and output, and the feature of adult neurogenesis. Despite the clinical relevance and experimental benefits, olfactory testing across animal models of neurodevelopmental disease has been inconsistent and non-standardized. Here we performed a systematic literature review of olfactory function testing in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, and identified intriguing inconsistencies that include evidence for both increased and decreased acuity in odor detection in various mouse models of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

899b2e41-f1bd-4b15-801f-ab9f646145f5,A systematic-review of olfactory deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders: From mouse to human,A. M. Lyons-Warren;I. Herman;P. J. Hunt;B. R. Arenkiel,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"Olfactory impairment is a common clinical motif across neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting olfactory circuits are particularly vulnerable to disease processes and can provide insight into underlying disease mechanisms. The mouse olfactory bulb is an ideal model system to study mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disease due to its anatomical accessibility, behavioral relevance, ease of measuring circuit input and output, and the feature of adult neurogenesis. Despite the clinical relevance and experimental benefits, olfactory testing across animal models of neurodevelopmental disease has been inconsistent and non-standardized. Here we performed a systematic literature review of olfactory function testing in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, and identified intriguing inconsistencies that include evidence for both increased and decreased acuity in odor detection in various mouse models of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Based on our identified gaps in the literature, we recommend direct comparison of different mouse models of ASD using standardized tests for odor detection and discrimination. This review provides a framework to guide future olfactory function testing in mouse models of neurodevelopmental diseases.",internal-pdf://3710898163/pubmed-33610612.pdf,"Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Neurology and Developmental Neuroscience, Clinical Care Center, Suite 1250, 6621 Fannin St, Houston, TX, 77030, United States.

Kat;M. Arroyo-Araujo;R. B. M. de Vries;M. A. Koopmans;S. F. de Boer;M. J. H. Kas,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"Predictive models are essential for advancing knowledge of brain disorders. High variation in study outcomes hampers progress. To address the validity of predictive models, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on behavioural phenotypes of the knock-out rodent model for Fragile X syndrome according to the PRISMA reporting guidelines. In addition, factors accountable for the heterogeneity between findings were analyzed. The knock-out model showed good translational validity and replicability for hyperactivity, cognitive and seizure phenotypes. Despite low replicability, translational validity was also found for social behaviour and sensory sensitivity, but not for attention, aggression and cognitive flexibility. Anxiety, acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition phenotypes, despite low replicability, were opposite to patient symptomatology. Subgroup analyses for experimental factors moderately explain the low replicability, these analyses were hindered by under-reporting of methodologies and environmental conditions. Together, the model has translational validity for most clinical phenotypes, but caution must be taken due to low effect sizes and high inter-study variability. These findings should be considered in view of other rodent models in preclinical research.",internal-pdf://1051817236/pubmed-35690123.pdf,"Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 7, 9747 AG Groningen, the Netherlands.

To address the validity of predictive models, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on behavioural phenotypes of the knock-out rodent model for Fragile X syndrome according to the PRISMA reporting guidelines. In addition, factors accountable for the heterogeneity between findings were analyzed. The knock-out model showed good translational validity and replicability for hyperactivity, cognitive and seizure phenotypes. Despite low replicability, translational validity was also found for social behaviour and sensory sensitivity, but not for attention, aggression and cognitive flexibility. Anxiety, acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition phenotypes, despite low replicability, were opposite to patient symptomatology. Subgroup analyses for experimental factors moderately explain the low replicability, these analyses were hindered by under-reporting of methodologies and environmental conditions. Together, the model has translational validity for most clinical phenotypes, but caution must be taken due to low effect sizes and high inter-study variability. These findings should be considered in view of other rodent models in preclinical research.",internal-pdf://1051817236/pubmed-35690123.pdf,"Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 7, 9747 AG Groningen, the Netherlands.
